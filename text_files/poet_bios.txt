ANNE SEXTON

era 1950 - 1970's

The modern model of the confessional poet,
Anne Sexton's signature style was highly personal verse that detailed
her struggles with mental illness, suicide, adultery, sex and
addiction. Her work conveyed an intimacy largely considered scandalous
for the time and untouched by poetic discourse.

Anne Sexton began writing as an adult on the advice of a therapist and a
priest -  within 10 years she had already won the Pulitzer Prize and established
herself as both a cautionary tale of self-destruction and artistic genius.

LANGSTON HUGHES

era 1920 - 1960's

A notable leader of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes is known for his
insights and portrayal of black life in America from the 1920's through 1960's.
Hughes distinguished himself with his literary reflections on black culture,
and sought to write about life in a way that reflected the entirety of black
experience including both societal suffering and a love of language and music.

One of the earliest innovators of a literary art form known as "jazz poetry",
Langston's style incorporated syncopated rhythms and repetitive musical phrasing
into his work. Jazz poetry became the basis for the work of the Beat Generation
and has evolved into modern
times as hip-hop.

PABLO NERUDA

era 1930's - 1960's

Pablo Neruda was the pen name for Neftali Ricardo Reyes Basoalso, born
July 12, 1904 in Chile. Pablo began writing as a teenager and often in
green ink, his personal symbol for desire and hope. Although his work
covered a variety of topics, he is most famous for his collection
"Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair" which established Neruda as a
"frank, sensuous spokesman for love." He equated women with nature raised to
the cosmic degree, and contextualized the women in his life into veritable
forces of the universe. His style was rich and varied.

Fiercely devoted to communism, he occupied a number of diplomatic positions and
won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971.
